# Music People, harken!

If you are part of the music department, here are the qualifications for sound:
Either you must get onto www.bfxr.net for sound effects (Of which we need DEARLY)
You may also use any music making software of your choice AS LONG AS its files can be saved in the .wav format

Or you can get onto Garage Band to create music, it must follow these qualifications::
  It must be 128 BPM
  It must be an upbeat sort of style unless you consult me first 
  Next You must have an 8-bit filter (I will post a tutorial to do so later)
  ::

If you'd like to send me the music you are working on email it to me @ xam5698@hotmail.com
Anyone who slacks off or isn't working will be put into another group or they will be relegated to testing
