# Coding team

Our task is probably the most complicated of all, though its not nearly as hard as you might think.  Here's a few things to consider
as you hack away at that poor, poor starter kit.

### Initial Tasks
A few things need to be done first:
* Scrolling backgrounds
* Implementing sprites, moving characters
* Collision detection

### Fun Things
These things aren't _that_ important, though they would be fun to tackle once we get the basics down.
* Day/night cycle
* Prettyful animations
* Parallax backgrounds
